TinyTimer
=========

This software is originally published at https://github.com/unak/TinyTimer .


What's This?
------------

A simple timer application for Windows.
You can use it just like a kitchen timer.


Requirements
------------

* Visual C# 2010 (or later)
* Windows XP or later


How to Compile
--------------

Open `TinyTimer.sln` with Visual C#, and do build.
So you can get TinyTimer\bin\Release\TinyTimer.exe.


How to Use
----------

Input time until alarm begins by number keys from your keyboard.
Then, hit `Enter` key (or push `Start` button) to start the timer.
You can stop the timer by hitting `Enter` key (or push `Stop` button), or hitting `ESC` key (or push `Reset` button).

If the label of a timer is double-clicked, the timer will become simple display mode.
In this mode there is no title bar nor buttons.
Double-click the label again to return to normal display mode.

By double-clicking the title bar, you can change the contents of it.
When two or more TinyTimers are started, it becomes easy for you to distinguish each TinyTimer by this.
